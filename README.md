# Introducing BoxOut
BoxOut is an interactive dashboard created for fantasy basketball enthusiasts to view real-time performance insights and player trends. It displays the top current performers and tracks patterns from recent NBA games to guide fantasy managers through potential trades and waiver moves. Additionally, BoxOut uses a tree-based gradient boosting model (using scikit-learn) to predict top performers and pop-off candates in future NBA games. 

Built using Dash & pandas
