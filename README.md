# Introducing BoxOut
BoxOut is an interactive dashboard created for fantasy basketball enthusiasts and/or addicts (like myself) to view real-time performance insights and player trends in a clear, straightforward manner. It displays the top current fantasy performers and tracks patterns from recent NBA games to guide fantasy managers through potential trades and waiver moves. BoxOut uses a tree-based gradient boosting model (trained using scikit-learn and managed using MLflow) to predict top performers and pop-off candidates for future NBA games. 

Built using Dash & pandas
